# Mixed Momentum Strategy

**Note: Consider this as an ongoing project for future purposes. Not intended to be published in its actual state.**

## Abstract 

Based on limits to arbitrage arguments and conclusions derived from our experiments in [Alpha Decay](https://github.com/itsNH98/alpha_decay), we devise a stock trading strategy effectively based on the interaction of three signals (i) uncertainty, as proxied by firm age (Zhang, 2006) (ii) individual stock return momentum (Jegadeesh, 1993) (iii) announcement return, proxied by standardized change in earnings or abnormal returns (Zhang, 2006). For a more exhaustive presentation, see the 'mixed_momentum_presentation.pdf' that is available in the repository.
